What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It initializes an empty Git repository. It is needed to begin making
commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area are files PENDING commit while the working directory
are untracked and not pending commit. This allows you to be selective 
about which files you add to commit.
