What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It initializes an empty Git repository. It is needed to begin making
commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area are files PENDING commit while the working directory
are untracked and not pending commit. This allows you to be selective 
about which files you add to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

Commit only the files that correspond to SINGLE LOGICAL change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

Situations involving testing experimental features, different language, etc

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
1) It makes it easy to see all the branches.
2) Clear where the head of each branch is
3) The parent of each node -> thus easy to follow branch lineage
4) Quickly determine common nodes between branches

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent 
it in the diagram the way we do?

A new node is created which has as parentS the heads of both branches. 
The current branch now points to this new node. The other branch doesn't 
change. Representation shows the dual parent relationship nature of 
the new node.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing 
merges manually?
Manual merges benefit has more stability as the programmer will review
before commiting. This has potential to be a time consuming operation.
Automatic merging is much quicker, but has much more potential for 
failure as the result may often not compile.
