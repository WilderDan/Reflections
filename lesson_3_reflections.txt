    When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
    your work local?

[Response]
    I would prefer to use a remote repository when I am colloborating with
    other people on a single project.

    Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
    Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

[Response]
    Automatic pulling has the potential to overwrite current work in 
    the local repository. This could happen if I have made some local 
    changes before I pushed the changes to remote.

    Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When
    would you use one instead of another?

[Response]
    Fork copies a GitHub repository to your account. Useful when you want
    to build off someone's code, but don't have permission to modify
    to the original.
    
    Clone copies a GitHub repository to your local machine.
    Useful if you want to work on an existing repository locally. 
    The benefit of this is that you can safely test new features without
    worrying that the remote version, which everyone else will access, 
    will be broke. Clone can also copy a local repository to another local 
    location.
    
    Branching allows for different commit histories. This is useful 
    if you want to test a new feature without affecting the master 
    branch. This allows for the master branch to remain stable while
    being able to experiment. Branches can also be merged.

    What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
    remote stored locally?

[Response]
    Enables you to easily see commits that have been done locally. Also,
    allows for you to merge your local commits with the remote when 
    additional commits have been applied to the remote.

    How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be 
    easier, and what would be harder?

[Response]
    I would collaborate over email by sending my files to the other persons
    and vice versa. It would be easier slightly in that it wouldn't require
    knowing how the details of Git. Merging would be much more time
    consuming.

[Reflection]
    When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than 
    directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?

[Response] 
    I would do so when I want to get feedback on a feature before adding
    directly to master. This allows for experimentation and stability.
    The downside is a more complicated workflow.
